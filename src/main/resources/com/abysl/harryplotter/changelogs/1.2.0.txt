Hello, thanks for trying out the new version of Harry Plotter! I spend a lot of time updating & maintaining harry plotter, so if you like any of the features in it, please consider sending a tip! In addition you can post your transaction ID on a github issue (feature, bug or setup question) and I'll work through them by order of tip amount. You can also feel free to shoot me an email. However: it is still a tip and I cannot guarantee I will be able to solve your problem in a reasonable amount of time

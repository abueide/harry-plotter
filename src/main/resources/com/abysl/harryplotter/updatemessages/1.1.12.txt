1.1.12 is a bugfix/feature release
* Add content to stats tab
* Add stagger settings per drive
* Add max concurrent plots to stagger settings
* Made browse button take you to the currently set directory
* Fixed bug where stats was showing total minutes instead of leftover minutes
* Fixed an issue where plots weren't autoqueueing after clicking the "start" button
* Fixed bug where if you select "force stop", the graceful stop option would disappear
* Fixed issue with using manually added keys that the fingerprint field filled in
* Clicking the "stop" button on a job now toggles whether the stagger manager will use that plot for more consistent behavior. (E.g. if you click stop on a currently running plot, the stagger manager won't immediately start it again. At least not until you click stop on it again.)

TODO
* Auto start stagger manager on startup

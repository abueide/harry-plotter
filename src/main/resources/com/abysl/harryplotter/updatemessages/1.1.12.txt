Hello, thanks for trying out the new version of Harry Plotter! I spent 30 hours in the past 3 days working on this release, so if you like any of the features in it, please consider sending a tip! In addition you can post your transaction ID on a github issue (feature, bug or setup question) and I'll work through them by order of tip amount. You can also feel free to shoot me an email. However: it is still a tip and I cannot guarantee I will be able to solve your problem in a reasonable amount of time

1.1.12 is a big feature release

* Add content to stats tab
* Add stagger settings per drive
* Add max concurrent plots to stagger settings
* Auto start stagger manager on startup if crashed/taskmanager killed or if graceful stop is selected when exiting. If you force stopped, it will not autostart the next time you open. This should be useful for people looking to automatically start plotting system boot.
* Auto clear temp dir on stagger manager start
* Made browse button take you to the currently set directory

Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug where stats was showing total minutes instead of leftover minutes
* Fixed an issue where plots weren't autoqueueing after clicking the "start" button
* Fixed bug where if you select "force stop", the graceful stop option would disappear
* Fixed issue with using manually added keys that the fingerprint field filled in
* Clicking the "stop" button on a job now toggles whether the stagger manager will use that plot for more consistent behavior. (E.g. if you click stop on a currently running plot, the stagger manager won't immediately start it again)

The official release brings a few extra bugfixes from the release candidate version.

* Fix global stagger
* Make stagger work even with no drives added
